Joe and Lily were best friends.
One day Joe and Lily decided to go on a
vacation to Madagascar. However, they didn't know
what to do with their Ridiculous pet polar bear named Poncho.
Poncho had been causing problems, due to constant planking.
Joe found a sitter for their pet, and spastically went on the trip.
